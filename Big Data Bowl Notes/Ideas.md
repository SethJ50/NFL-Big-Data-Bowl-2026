Current top idea:
- Create a completion percentage model (use players involved in play after ball is released) for deep passes
	- need to consider how good/bad the pass is, not all blame goes on WR
	- brings idea, project where the pass should go to maximize completion percentage ðŸ‘€
- Evaluate how individual defenders (and the targeted receiver) decrease (or increase) the completion probability after release of the ball, and use this to create ratings for these players (could also do this as a team defense)
- Create a cool animation visualization with a opaque circle surrounding the targeted receiver encoding current completion probability
	- If we want this, we need a model that can compute completion probability at each frame somehow... can it be a rolling model that takes into the last few frames??
- Also create some cool outcome visualizations showing the rankings of defenders/receivers in these categories

Other potential ideas:
- Rank receivers based on how they help their QBs when they have to 'scramble' (i.e. get out of a sack, etc.)
- Analysis of screen passes somehow - idea of screen passes decreasing the pressure that QBs see - an alternate method of pass blocking
- Route running / route effectiveness... use their increased completion percentage throughout the course of the route to show how effective a receiver is in key parts of the route
