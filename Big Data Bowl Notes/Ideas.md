Do we have play results? If so:
- Intended Receiver: 
	- Deep Ball completion percentage over expectation
	- In air separation
- Defenders:
	- Success rate at preventing completion
	- In air separation (decrease)

1) Create a model for pass completion based on the intended receiver and the defenders around them...
2) Over time, evaluate how the player moves to increase or decrease that completion expectation

Model how well a group of defenders as a whole shrink the percentage of a completion based on their movement

Model where a player should go to increase their chances at a completion, and evaluate which players excel at pursuing those paths
